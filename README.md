&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello average Internet user, you may be wondering right now what the hell is this organization and what we do, although you probably aren't, really. Despite this, it is my duty as a `README.md` file of an organization to tell you everything related to this software organization (although the truth is that it is not that bad).
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it turns out that we are a non-profit organization (at the moment) dedicated to building open source software, and we are in charge of programming those pieces of software that you wish existed but for some reason have not been programmed yet.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we are a very collaborative organization and we listen to the users of our products, helping them as we can and trying to include their ideas in our projects, because we love the community.
<br>
